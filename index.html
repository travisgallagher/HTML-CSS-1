    <h1>NFL Basics:</h1>
    <h3>The NFL stands for "National Football League". </h3>
    <h5>
        There are 32 total teams that are broken down into two different conferences, the NFC (National Football Conference) and the AFC (American Football Conference). 
    </h5>

    <h5>From there, the two conferences, are broken down into divisions. Both Conferences contain 4 divisions. Which means there are 8 divisions total in the NFL. </h5>
    <h5>The divisions contain 4 teams each, and are separated by geographical locations. <br/> The divisions are named after their locations, so we have the "Conference" + North, East, West, and South. </h5>
    <h5>Example: The Philadelphia Eagles are in the NFC East Division. <br/>
    Conference: The NFC <br/> Division: The NFC East <br/> Team: Philadelphia Eagles </h5>
